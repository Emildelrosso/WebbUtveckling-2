        <h2>The Hunters and The Hunt</h2>
        <p>The hunters are a group of warriors who are dedicated to keeping their regions safe by hunting down beasts or anything other than beasts that pose a threat.</p>

        <p>Hunters are agile fighters armed with a trick weapon, a transforming melee weapon in the right hand, and a firearm in the left. They do not have shields, but rather take advantage of their mobility in order to avoid attacks.</p>

        <p>Hunters exist throughout the world and are not exclusive to Yharnam, since a number of characters such as the protagonist and Eileen come from the outside world and are yet still recognized as hunters.</p>   
        
        <p>However, it is believed that the Hunters started out as a branch of the Healing Church very much like The Choir. This would mean that, at least in Yharnam, Hunters were recruited by either Gehrman or the Church itself.</p>
